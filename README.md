# Hi there! 👋

Passionate since I was 15, with 8 years of professional experience.
I love building modern web applications using Angular, React, and Vue 🥰.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🌟 Featured Projects
🍕 BuildYourSlice: A virtual pizza creator where users can add their favorite ingredients to a dough and calculate the total price. In the future, I plan to expand it into a comprehensive food ordering platform with payment integration.

📸 PhotoBooth: A spontaneous, one-day project inspired by my son’s 1st birthday. I quickly decided to find a used camera and photo printer on a second-hand app, purchased them on a budget, and combined them with a custom app I developed. The result? A system that could take three photos of guests and instantly print them as keepsakes.

🎥 VodSearcher: A handy tool for collecting and organizing movies available on the VOD platforms I use. It helps my family and me quickly find the perfect movie for our evening entertainment.

🎸 EasyGuitar: A mobile guitar simulator for Windows Phone. This was my first major project as a passionate university student, and it played a key role in landing my first job during a job interview.
